# odin-recipes
This is my website project, following The Odin Project!

This current project aims to practice some basic knowledge about HTML, by creating a basic recipe website.

This website, will consist of a main index pge, which will have links to a few recipes.

By completing this project, I hope to demonstrate some basic skills I'm developing on HTML.
