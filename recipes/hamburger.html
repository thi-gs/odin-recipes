    <ul>
        <li><h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground chuck - We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
            <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
            <li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
            <li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Steps to make the perfect Burger</li></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</li>
            <li>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
            <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.</li>
            <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your favorite hamburger toppings and condiments.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
